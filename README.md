# git-utils

A collection of useful git scripts and tools.

Currently, it's just a script to support git user management, which I found useful when working with multiple git accounts.

# countdown

A simple countdown timer for macOS, written in Python.

Useful for timing your breaks or for the Pomodoro technique.
